  abstract = "Genetic rescue (GR) is an important tool in conservation biology
              for the management of highly inbred populations. However, GR
              comes at a potential cost: the reduction in native genomic
              content. The degree to which adaptive evolution for new immigrant
              alleles lead to complete or partial replacement of the native
              genome, depends on recombination rates, genome size, effective
              population sizes, and distributions of fitness effects. As one of
              the most well-studied examples of an inbred species that
              exchanged genetic material with a less inbred species, we use
              Neanderthals and humans as an example. Using simulations, we show
              that for parameters realistic for these species, the increase in
              fitness caused by GR is mirrored by an almost proportional
              reduction in the fraction of the native genome preserved. The
              main reason is that the effect of selection will be strongest in
              the first few generations during which time there is only little
              break-up, by recombination, of the immigrant chromosomes. We also
              show that in the presence of a strong and short-lived bottleneck
              with recessive mutations, GR leads to a stronger increase in
              fitness than in the presence of additive effects or a more
              prolonged bottleneck.",

              chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases A$\beta$ plaques.
              However, tau, not A$\beta$, accumulation appears to drive AD
              neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding
              and spreading were influenced by the sleep-wake cycle and SD.
              Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90\% during normal wakefulness
              versus sleep and ~100\% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased
              more than 50\% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model,
              chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically
              driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF
              A$\beta$ and tau. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle regulates ISF tau,
