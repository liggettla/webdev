# SQL {#sql}

## Intro
SQL stands for structured query language that is designed to facilitate accessing data that is structured into table form. PostgreSQL is a version of SQL that is used in these notes.

## Installation
The method I can easily get to work is by installing through `apt`.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client
```
Both the default database user and default database are called postgres, so switch to that user.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo -u postgres bash
```
Then start a server.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
psql
```

I have not been able to get the installation working through a conda install but here is the reference to postgresql.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge postgresql
```

## Creating a Database
Note that reserved words are all being capitalized below, but this is not required, but rather a stylistic choice.

Below is the general syntax to create a PostgreSQL database.  
The `id` is being used in a manner similar to an index that will just number each of the items.  
The next three lines are all different data, and are of types `VARCHAR` and `INTEGER`.  
The `NOT NULL` aspect will cause the server to reject the entry if some data is added to the database but that value is not included.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
CREATE TABLE flights (           
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,       
    origin VARCHAR NOT NULL,     
    destination VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL    
);                               
```

Display the currently created databases.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
\d
```

Insert data into the flights database.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('New York', 'London', 415);
```

Select all the data from flights.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights;
```

Select only the origin and destination columns from flights.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT origin, destination FROM flights;
```

Select only the data in flights where the id is 3.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id = 3;
```

Select only the data in flights that have an origin of New York.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = 'New York';
```

Boolean logic data selection from flights.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE destination = 'Paris' AND duration > 500;
```

Average a column of data.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT AVG(duration) FROM flights;
```

Combine boolean logic with calculations performed on the data.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT AVG(duration) FROM flights WHERE origin = 'New York';
```

Count columns of matching data.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights;
```

Select matching data from a list.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin IN ('New York', 'Lima');
```

Wildcards can be used to search for substrings.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin LIKE '%a%';
```

SQL uses `LIMIT` to function like `HEAD`.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 2;
```

## Updating Data

This will change the duration of the flight from New York to London to 430.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
UPDATE flights
SET duration = 430
WHERE origin = 'New York'
AND destination = 'London';
```

Delete a set of matching data from a database.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
DELETE FROM flights
WHERE destination = 'Tokyo';
```
